1. Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?

No README file. Commits were descriptive. Could have possibly used a few more?

2. Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?

The code is very easy to read.

3. Were branching and looping used effectively?

Very effectively. Cut down on your HTML file by putting it in loops on in jQuery.

4. Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?

Yes it is!

5. Is the site user-friendly?

Very much so.

6. Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

Other than tossing in a README (which you may have ran out of time for) I think it looks awesome!
